         ### ‚ùóÔ∏è Read this before submitting your bug report:
         - **Write in English.** Reports in all other languages will be closed.
         - **Provide as much detail as possible** - error logs, screenshots, your exact configuration. If the issue cannot be reproduced, it cannot be fixed.
         - **Avoid reporting "error 500" or "white page" errors** - this is a universal error message that does not provide enough information to qualify the issue. Enable debug mode in the Performance section of PrestaShop or manually in `/config/defines.inc.php` and try again. You should get a proper error message.
